VERSION 2018.08:
    --Changed "print=" keyword to "show=" in several solvers. This is to avoid
    confusion with the python "print" reserved keyword. As of this version, using
    the all keyword will raise a warning. Future version will raise an error.

    --Added an option to demo.savefig to specified file formats
